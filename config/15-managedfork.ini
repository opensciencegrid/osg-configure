; or not. You should set this to True or False
enabled = FALSE

; This setting is optional and will allow globus to accept limited proxies if set. 
; Changing this is not needed for almost all sites. If set to True it will add 
; the "accept_limited" option into /etc/grid-services/jobmanager-managed-fork. 
; If it is set to False or not set then that prefix will not be added.
;
; By default this is set to False
;
; Most sites will not need to change this 
; accept_limited = False

; The condor_location setting should give the location of condor install directory

; You should not have to set this for most condor installations since osg-configure
; will determine this for you by checking the typical rpm installation locations
; and/or using the CONDOR_LOCATION environment variable
; condor_location = DEFAULT

; The condor_location setting should give the location of condor config file,
; This is typically  /etc/condor/condor_config with rpm installations of condor
; or $CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config if you are using a tarball install of 
; condor
; If you leave this set to DEFAULT, configure-osg will attempt to
; determine the correct value.
; You should not have to set this for most condor installations since osg-configure
; will determine this for you by checking the typical rpm installation locations
; and/or using the CONDOR_CONFIG environment variable
