[Gateway]
; This section has settings for selecting and configuring the daemon
; on your CE that sends jobs to other job managers on your CE,
; called the job gateway (or just gateway). As of Nov. 2006, this is
; HTCondor-CE (from the htcondor-ce package).
;
; In addition to enabling the gateways on a CE, these settings are
; used to tell other services, such as the various job managers
; which gateways are being used.
;
; This setting configures the services that use the gateway to
; use HTCondor-CE. The following things will happen if this is
; set to True:
;   - HTCondor-CE will be configured to work with the job managers
;     that are enabled in the other config files.
htcondor_gateway_enabled = True


; This is the value of the environment variable PATH that gets
; set for jobs; it will get added to osg-job-environment.conf
job_envvar_path=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin
