OSG-Configure
=============

OSG-Configure is a tool to configure multiple pieces of Grid software from a single set of configuration files.


Installation
------------

OSG-Configure is typically installed via RPMs from the OSG repositories.
See [OSG documentation for how to enable the repositories](https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/common/yum/);
once the repos are enabled, install by running

    yum install osg-configure


OSG-Configure can also be installed from a checkout.
Run

    git clone https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-configure
    cd osg-configure
    make install

**NOTE:** this will overwrite existing config files in `/etc/osg/config.d`;
to install only the program, instead of `make install`, run

    make install-noconfig


Invocation and script usage
---------------------------

The `osg-configure` script is used to process the INI files and apply changes to the system.
`osg-configure` must be run as root.

The typical workflow of OSG-Configure is to first edit the INI files, then verify them, then apply the changes.

To verify the config files, run:
``` console
[root@server] osg-configure -v
```

OSG-Configure will list any errors in your configuration, usually including the section and option where the problem is.
Potential problems are:

-   Required option not filled in
-   Invalid value
-   Syntax error
-   Inconsistencies between options

To apply changes, run:
``` console
[root@server] osg-configure -c
```

Errors are logged in `/var/log/osg/osg-configure.log`.
To get more detailed error information in the log, add `-d` to the `osg-configure` invocation.

OSG-Configure is split up into modules. Normally, all modules are run when calling `osg-configure`.
However, it is possible to run specific modules separately.
To see a list of modules, including whether they can be run separately, run:
``` console
[root@server] osg-configure -l
```
If the module can be run separately, specify it with the `-m <MODULE>` option, where `<MODULE>` is one of the items
of the output of the previous command.

``` console
[root@server] osg-configure -c -m <MODULE>
```

Options may be specified in multiple INI files, which may make it hard to determine which value OSG-Configure uses.
You may query the final value of an option via one of these methods:
``` console
[root@server] osg-configure -q -o <OPTION>
[root@server] osg-configure -q -o <SECTION>.<OPTION>
```

Where `<OPTION>` is the variable from which we want to know the value and `<SECTION>` refers to a section in any of the INI
files, i.e. any name between brackets e.g. `[Squid]`.



### Conventions ###

In the tables below:

-   Mandatory options for a section are given in **bold** type. Sometime the default value may be OK and no edit required, but the variable has to be in the file.
-   Options that are not found in the default ini file are in *italics*.



Syntax and layout
-----------------

The configuration files used by `osg-configure` are the one supported by Python's [SafeConfigParser](https://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html), similar in format to the [INI configuration file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) used by MS Windows:

-   Config files are separated into sections, specified by a section name in square brackets (e.g. `[Section 1]`)
-   Options should be set using `name = value` pairs
-   Lines that begin with `;` or `#` are comments
-   Long lines can be split up using continutations: each white space character can be preceded by a newline to fold/continue the field on a new line (same syntax as specified in [email RFC 822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822.html))
-   Variable substitutions are supported -- [see below](#variable-substitution)

`osg-configure` reads and uses all of the files in `/etc/osg/config.d` that have a ".ini" suffix. The files in this directory are ordered with a numeric prefix with higher numbers being applied later and thus having higher precedence (e.g. `00-foo.ini` has a lower precedence than `99-local-site-settings.ini`). Configuration sections and options can be specified multiple times in different files. E.g. a section called `[PBS]` can be given in `20-pbs.ini` as well as `99-local-site-settings.ini`.

Each of the files are successively read and merged to create a final configuration that is then used to configure OSG software. Options and settings in files read later override the ones in previous files. This allows admins to create a file with local settings (e.g. `99-local-site-settings.ini`) that can be read last and which will be take precedence over the default settings in configuration files installed by various RPMs and which will not be overwritten if RPMs are updated.


### Variable substitution ###

The osg-configure parser allows variables to be defined and used in the configuration file:
any option set in a given section can be used as a variable in that section.  Assuming that you have set an option with the name `myoption` in the section, you can substitute the value of that option elsewhere in the section by referring to it as `%(myoption)s`.

**Note:**<br>
The trailing `s` is required. Also, option names cannot have a variable substitution in them.

### Special Settings ###

If a setting is set to UNAVAILABLE or DEFAULT or left blank, osg-configure will try to use a sensible default for setting if possible.

#### Ignore setting ####

The `enabled` option, specifying whether a service is enabled or not, is a boolean but also accepts `Ignore` as a possible value. Using Ignore, results in the service associated with the section being ignored entirely (and any configuration is skipped). This differs from using `False` (or the `%(disabled)s` variable), because using `False` results in the service associated with the section being disabled. `osg-configure` will not change the configuration of the service if the `enabled` is set to `Ignore`.

This is useful, if you have a complex configuration for a given that can't be set up using the ini configuration files. You can manually configure that service by hand editing config files, manually start/stop the service and then use the `Ignore` setting so that `osg-configure` does not alter the service's configuration and status.




Configuration sections
----------------------

The OSG configuration is divided into sections with each section starting with a section name in square brackets (e.g. `[Section 1]`).
The configuration is split in multiple files and options form one section can be in more than one files.
All of the configuration files listed below are in `/etc/osg/config.d/`.


### 01-squid.ini / [Squid] section ###

This section handles the configuration and setup of the squid web caching and proxy service.

This section is contained in `/etc/osg/config.d/01-squid.ini` which is provided by the `osg-configure-squid` RPM.

| Option      | Values Accepted           | Explanation                                                    |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **enabled** | `True`, `False`, `Ignore` | This indicates whether the squid service is being used or not. |
| location    | String                    | This should be set to the `hostname:port` of the squid server. |


### 10-gateway.ini / [Gateway] section ###

This section gives information about the options in the Gateway section of the configuration files. These options control the behavior of job gateways on the CE. CEs are based on HTCondor-CE, which uses `condor-ce` as the gateway.

This section is contained in `/etc/osg/config.d/10-gateway.ini` which is provided by the `osg-configure-gateway` RPM.

| Option                         | Values Accepted | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **htcondor\_gateway\_enabled** | `True`, `False` | (default True). True if the CE is using HTCondor-CE, False otherwise. HTCondor-CE will be configured to support enabled batch systems. RSV will use HTCondor-CE to launch remote probes. |
| **job\_envvar\_path**          | String          | The value of the PATH environment variable to put into HTCondor jobs running with HTCondor-CE. This value is ignored if not using that batch system/gateway combination.                 |


### 10-misc.ini / [Misc Services] section ###

This section handles the configuration of services that do not have a dedicated section for their configuration.

This section is contained in `/etc/osg/config.d/10-misc.ini` which is provided by the `osg-configure-misc` RPM.

This section primarily deals with authentication/authorization. For information on suggested settings for your CE, see the [authentication section of the HTCondor-CE install documents](../compute-element/install-htcondor-ce#configuring-authentication).

| Option                                | Values Accepted                       | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **authorization\_method**             | `gridmap`, `local-gridmap`, `vomsmap` | This indicates which authorization method your site uses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| edit\_lcmaps\_db                      | `True`, `False`                       | (Optional, default True) If true, osg-configure will overwrite `/etc/lcmaps.db` to set your authorization method. The previous version will be backed up to `/etc/lcmaps.db.pre-configure`                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| all\_fqans                            | `True`, `False`                       | (Optional, default False) If true, vomsmap auth will use all VOMS FQANs of a proxy for mapping -- see [documentation](../security/lcmaps-voms-authentication#mapping-using-all-fqans)                                                                                                                                                                                                |


### 10-storage.ini / [Storage] section ###

This section gives information about the options in the Storage section of the configuration file.
Several of these values are constrained and need to be set in a way that is consistent with one of the OSG storage models.
Please review the OSG documentation on the [Worker Node Environment](https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/worker-node/using-wn/#the-worker-node-environment),
and [Site Planning](https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/site-planning/).

This section is contained in `/etc/osg/config.d/10-storage.ini` which is provided by the `osg-configure-ce` RPM.

| Option           | Values Accepted | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **grid_dir**     | String          | This setting should point to the directory which holds the files from the OSG worker node package. See note                                                                                                    |
| app_dir          | String          | This setting should point to the directory which contains the VO specific applications. See note                                                                                                               |
| data_dir         | String          | This setting should point to a directory that can be used to store and stage data in and out of the cluster. See note                                                                                          |
| worker_node_temp | String          | This directory should point to a directory that can be used as scratch space on compute nodes. If not set, the default is UNAVAILABLE. See note                                                                |
| site_read        | String          | This setting should be the location or url to a directory that can be read to stage in data via the variable `$OSG_SITE_READ`. This is an url if you are using a SE. If not set, the default is UNAVAILABLE    |
| site_write       | String          | This setting should be the location or url to a directory that can be write to stage out data via the variable `$OSG_SITE_WRITE`. This is an url if you are using a SE. If not set, the default is UNAVAILABLE |


**Note:**<br>
The above variables may be set to an environment variable that is set on your site's worker nodes.
For example, if each of your worker nodes has a different location for its scratch directory specified by
`LOCAL_SCRATCH_DIR`, set the following configuration:

    [Storage]
    worker_node_temp = $LOCAL_SCRATCH_DIR

**Note for grid_dir:**<br>
If you have installed the worker node client via RPM (the normal case) it should be `/etc/osg/wn-client`.
If you have installed the worker node in a special location (perhaps via the worker node client tarball or via OASIS),
it should be the location of that directory.

This directory will be accessed via the `$OSG_GRID` environment variable.
It should be visible on all of the compute nodes. Read access is required,
though worker nodes don't need write access.

**Note for app_dir:**<br>
This directory will be accesed via the `$OSG_APP` environment variable. It
should be visible on both the CE and worker nodes. Only the CE needs to
have write access to this directory. This directory must also contain a
sub-directory `etc/` with 1777 permissions.

This directory may also be in OASIS, in which case set `app_dir` to
`/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org`. (The CE does not need write access in
that case.)

**Note for data_dir:**<br>
This directory can be accessed via the `$OSG_DATA` environment variable. It
should be readable and writable on both the CE and worker nodes.

**Note for worker_node_temp:**<br>
This directory will be accessed via the `$OSG_WN_TMP` environment variable.
It should allow read and write access on a worker node and can be visible
to just that worker node.

### 20-condor.ini / [Condor] section ###

This section describes the parameters for a Condor jobmanager if it's being used in the current CE installation.
If Condor is not being used, the `enabled` setting should be set to `False`.

This section is contained in `/etc/osg/config.d/20-condor.ini` which is provided by the `osg-configure-condor` RPM.

### 30-gratia.ini / [Gratia] section ###

This section configures Gratia. If `probes` is set to `UNAVAILABLE`, then `osg-configure` will use appropriate default values. If you need to specify custom reporting (e.g. a local gratia collector) in addition to the default probes, `%(osg-jobmanager-gratia)s`, `%(osg-gridftp-gratia)s`, `%(osg-metric-gratia)s`, `%(itb-jobmanager-gratia)s`, `%(itb-gridftp-gratia)s`, `%(itb-metric-gratia)s` are defined in the default configuration files to make it easier to specify the standard osg reporting.

This section is contained in `/etc/osg/config.d/30-gratia.ini` which is provided by the `osg-configure-gratia` RPM.

| Option       | Values Accepted            | Explanation                                                                                                                           |

| **probes**   | String                     | This should be set to the gratia probes that should be enabled. A probe is specified by using as `[probe_type]:server:port`. See note |

**Note for probes:**<br>
Legal values for the `probe_type` part are:

-   `metric` (for RSV)
-   `jobmanager` (for the appropriate jobmanager probe)
-   `gridftp` (for the GridFTP transfer probe)


### 30-infoservices.ini / [Info Services] section ###

Reporting to the central CE Collectors is configured in this section.  In the majority of cases, this file can be left untouched; you only need to configure this section if you wish to report to your own CE Collector instead of the ones run by OSG Operations.

This section is contained in `/etc/osg/config.d/30-infoservices.ini`, which is provided by the `osg-configure-infoservices` RPM. (This is for historical reasons.)

**Note for srm_webservice_path:**<br>
For dcache installations, this should work if left blank. However
Bestman-xrootd SEs normally use `srm/v2/server` as web service path, and so
Bestman-xrootd admins will have to pass this option with the appropriate
value (for example: `srm/v2/server`) for the SRM probes to pass on their
SE.


### 30-gip.ini / [Subcluster] and [Resource Entry] sections ###

Subcluster and Resource Entry configuration is for reporting about the worker resources on your site. A **subcluster** is a homogeneous set of worker node hardware; a **resource** is a set of subcluster(s) with common capabilities that will be reported to the ATLAS AGIS system.

**At least one Subcluster or Resource Entry section** is required on a CE; please populate the information for all your subclusters. This information will be reported to a central collector and will be used to send GlideIns / pilot jobs to your site; having accurate information is necessary for OSG jobs to effectively use your resources.

This section is contained in `/etc/osg/config.d/30-gip.ini` which is provided by the `osg-configure-gip` RPM. (This is for historical reasons.)

This configuration uses multiple sections of the OSG configuration files:

-   [Subcluster\*](#subcluster-configuration): options about homogeneous subclusters
-   [Resource Entry\*](#resource-entry-configuration-atlas-only): options for specifying ATLAS queues for AGIS

#### Notes for multi-CE sites. ####

If you would like to properly advertise multiple CEs per cluster, make sure that you:

-   Set the value of site\_name in the "Site Information" section to be the same for each CE.
-   Have the **exact** same configuration values for the Subcluster\* and Resource Entry\* sections in each CE.


#### Subcluster Configuration ####

Each homogeneous set of worker node hardware is called a **subcluster**.
For each subcluster in your cluster, fill in the information about the worker node hardware by creating a new Subcluster section in the following format:
`[Subcluster CHANGEME]`, where CHANGEME is the subcluster name.
If you have multiple subclusters, they must have different names.

#### Resource Entry Configuration (ATLAS only) ####

If you are configuring a CE for the ATLAS VO, you must provide hardware information to advertise the queues that are available to AGIS. For each queue, create a new `Resource Entry` section with a unique name in the following format: `[Resource Entry RESOURCE]` where RESOURCE is a globally unique resource name (it must be a **globally** unique name for the whole grid, not just unique to your site). The following options are required for the `Resource Entry` section and are used to generate the data required by AGIS:

### 35-pilot.ini / [Pilot] ###

These sections describe the size and scale of GlideinWMS pilots that your site is willing to accept.
This file contains multiple sections of the form `[Pilot <PILOT_TYPE>]`,
where `<PILOT_TYPE>` is a free-form name of a type of pilot.
The name should only have lower-case letters, numbers, and `-` or `_` characters.
In addition, it must be unique within your cluster.
We recommend a name that describes the capabilities of the pilots you accept.
Good names are `singularity_8core`, `gpu`, `bigmem`, `main`.

The following attributes are required:

### 40-localsettings.ini / [Local Settings] ###

This section differs from other sections in that there are no set options in this section. Rather, the options set in this section will be placed in the `osg-local-job-environment.conf` verbatim. The options in this section are case sensitive and the case will be preserved when they are converted to environment variables. The `osg-local-job-environment.conf` file gets sourced by jobs run on your cluster so any variables set in this section will appear in the environment of jobs run on your system.

Adding a line such as `My_Setting = my_Value` would result in the an environment variable called `My_Setting` set to `my_Value` in the job's environment. `my_Value` can also be defined in terms of an environment variable (i.e `My_Setting = $my_Value`) that will be evaluated on the worker node. For example, to add a variable `MY_PATH` set to `/usr/local/myapp`, you'd have the following:

``` ini
[Local Settings]

MY_PATH = /usr/local/myapp
```

This section is contained in `/etc/osg/config.d/40-localsettings.ini` which is provided by the `osg-configure-ce` RPM.


### 40-siteinfo.ini / [Site Information] section ###

The settings found in the `Site Information` section are described below. This section is used to give information about a resource such as resource name, site sponsors, administrators, etc.

This section is contained in `/etc/osg/config.d/40-siteinfo.ini` which is provided by the `osg-configure-ce` RPM.
